# The following rules are to hide the root level /php/ and /php/main/
# folders from the URL. We want to simulate users accessing files under these
# folders as if they were are the root / of the website.
# This is needed to maintain the links other websites (like Lemon Amiga) made
# to /games/games_details.php?game_id=...

# If request are coming for /php/something.php, redirect them to /something.php
# Use 307 and not 301 to cover POST redirection (See issue #250)

# If the requested folder or file doesn't exist, look it up under php/
# For example if the request is /main/front/front.php, look it up
# at php/main/front/front.php
# __Note__  It works with conjunction with php/.htaccess, so that requests
# to /front/front.php gets rewritten to main/front/front.php first, then
# front/front.php by php/.htaccess
