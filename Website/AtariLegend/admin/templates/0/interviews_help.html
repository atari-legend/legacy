		<b>Adding an interview</b>
		<br>
		<br>
		The first thing that needs to be done is to add an actual interview in the DB. We need to link an
		interview to an actual person.
		<br>
		To add an interview to the AL DB you click on the "Add an Interview" link at the left side. There you'll have to search for the individual you want to interview.
		<br>
		<br>
		Now you will enter the interview main screen. This is where the actual interview is inserted in the DB. Overhere you'll notice 3 main text boxes.
		<br>
		The 3 boxes are : 
		<br>
		<br>
		<i>- Intro :</i> This is where you'll write a little introduction to the interview. This text is placed in the boxes of the main interview section of AL (and in the search results) 
		<br>
		<i>- Chapters :</i> This is a section especially created for chapters. Its a bit more complex. You just add as many chapters as you like. 
		<br>
		<br>
		<i>example : Introduction.</i> 
		<br>
		<i>example : It started back then.</i>
		<br>
		<br>
		These chapters should have some sort of hotspot. Therefor you should always select each chapter and press the hotspotsource button. It also necesarry to give each chapter a unique number (behind the # sign). 
		This chapter can be link to a certain place in the actual interview section by selecting the place and pressing the hotspottarget button. And ofcourse adding the appropriate number. 
		<br>
		<br>
		<i>- Interview :</i> This is where you'll add the actual interview text. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Remember that you have a lot of freedom regarding layout issues. Even the "enters" you place in a text field are translated to the AL page, so make something nice of it, will you? :-) 
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>Editing an interview</b>
		<br>
		<br>
		Once the interview is added to the DB, it's time to add some screenshots to the whole thing. You do this by using the
		'Search for an Interview' section on the main page. Once the search result are on screen, you'll notice you can edit, preview, delete and add screenshots to the interview.
		<br>
		<br>
		Once screenshots have been linked to the interview, you can edit it and add comments to the shots you uploaded.
		Remember the order you upload is the order shown at the interview.
